Repository for my project in the "Collecting Data" course at the University of Groningen

I would like to examine the SCP Foundation, an online collaborative urban fiction wiki. There is currently nearly no research literature on the SCP Foundation, which is surprising to me, since to me personally, it is one of the greatest digital fiction projects currently in existence. I was able to find the following literature:

Crawford, J. Gothic Digital Technologies. Wester, M.; Aldana Reyes, X. (2019): Twenty-First Century Gothic. An Edinburgh Companion. 
Mittman, A.S.; Hensel, M. (2018). The SCP (Special Containment Procedures) Foundation. Primary Sources on Monsters. Demonstrare, Volume Two.
Publishers Weekly (18 Nov 2019). SCP Foundation: Irish Through the Looking Glass, Vol. 1.

The last of these three articles is not about the project itself, but about a traditionally published fan project. There therefore seems to be a lack of research on the topic that I would like to partially fill.

Research question:

One interesting element of the SCP Foundation is a lack of a shared canon. The project itself is a wiki, on which writers write articles. These are mostly self-contained, but some contain references to other articles, building "canon groups".

I would like to map these canon groups using Gephi. The concrete research question would be: How much of the SCP Foundation is self-contained and how much is part of a canon group?

The data needed for this does not exist yet, but can probably be scraped from the SCP Foundation website.
